# AWS-Spark-App

This notebook was created using the AWS Amazon EMR.

The goal was to experiment and test the use of PySpark on a cloud environment, using yarn cluster and a master-slave architecture.

As such, some common operations and transformations were applied to synthetic data. The data was generated (code provided) and was stored and acessed from the hdfs.
